Using Django's class-based views (CBVs), I created a basic task management API for this assignment. The API can be used to create, retrieve, update, and delete individual tasks, among other things. 
Additionally, bulk operations were added, enabling users to add and remove several tasks with a single request.

Key features of the task server include:
    Create Tasks: Users can add a new task with a title and completion status using a POST request.
    Retrieve Tasks: Users can retrieve the details of a specific task by its ID or list all tasks.
    Update Tasks: Users can update the title and completion status of a task using a PUT request.
    Delete Tasks: Users can delete a specific task or bulk delete multiple tasks at once.

I extensively tested the API endpoints using POSTMAN, a powerful tool that allows us to send HTTP requests and verify the responses returned by the server. 
Through Postman, I was able to check the functionality of each endpoint, ensuring that they work as expected and handle errors gracefully.
